# Using the population.csv and regionarea.csv files, calculate the population density of all Cities in the Philippines.
# However, since only areas for regions are provided (in square kilometers), assume that all cities in a particular region will have equal land area. (E.g. Area of City in Region 1 = Area of Region 1/Number of Cities in Region 1)
# The R Code should be able to output a CSV file that lists down the top 5 cities with the highest densities.
